# Building an automatic doorbell system with facial recognition for business

This project aims to create an advanced doorbell system equipped with facial recognition technology for business environments. The system will automatically recognize and log individuals entering the premises, providing enhanced security and convenience. The main components will include a camera module, facial recognition software, and a user-friendly interface for management and monitoring.

## Description
Ubiquiti already has a doorbell system that works reliably; however, it is lacking functionality that traditionally are needed by doorbells (and advanced features):
- Physical button to ring the app
- Physical button to ring the buzzer
- Alerts for unknown people
- AI / Facial recognition opening
- AI / Facial recognition for detecting intrusions.

Your goal will be to build the full system to exceed the current capabilities of Ubiquiti.  This will done using a Raspberry Pi, a camera, and other hardware (relays, door strikes, buttons, etc).  This is a full-stack project plus a hardware element.

This project is ideal for students who are interested in both AI, software development and physical hardware.  It is designed to be interesting for students who want to do hardware design as well.

The team running this capstone project expects that you will need to learn lots on the project.  We have the experience to help you with the project and teach you more about networking, software design and best practices.   Making you the best developers out there.

## Scope
- Develop a facial recognition system to identify authorized individuals.
- Integrate a camera module with the doorbell system.
- Implement software for real-time recognition and logging.
- Hardware elements such as opening doors.
- Create a management interface for adding/removing individuals and viewing logs.
- Ensure the system is scalable and secure, suitable for business environments.

## Resources provided by client:

You will be provided access to the clientâ€™s research infrastructure for AI training.

Any additional services or compute required will be provided on request by students.

The client will provide funding and hardware for the project when required.

If students have access to their own GPU hardware, that would also be great.  Training AI Models can take a very long time on laptops.  We will be discouraging this method.  This is why we provide access to GPUs when needed on the project.

Compute should not be an issue with this project.

Data will be provided to the students as well.  We have large amounts of data and are using it ourselves to train models.  We are gathering more data every day.
