# AI system to study effectiveness of advertising in shopping centres with real-time analysis and feedback

This project aims to develop an AI-powered camera monitoring system to assess the effectiveness of advertisements in small-scale or local shopping centres. The system will analyze consumer behaviour in real-time to provide actionable insights on advertising performance. The metrics collected will include average dwell time, foot traffic count, consumer interaction with ads, subsequent purchasing behaviour, and pedestrian heatmaps.

## Description

This is being completed in the context of advertising effectiveness in these shopping centres.  

You will be using a dataset compressed of people.  The people will be either looking at the advertisement or not.   Your goal is to ascertain how many people looked at the advertisement or camera directly.  You will need to use eye tracking, face detection and other elements to deliver the metrics above.

Your results should be presented in a website.  

The suggested AI model being tested currently is a variant of the YOLOv8 model.  This project is open-ended and will allow you to be flexible in selecting, training and utilising the model that your team feels is the best for the job.

The team running this capstone project expects that you will need to learn lots on the project.  We have the experience to help you with the project and teach you more about AI, software design and best practices.   Making you the best developers out there.  

AI is a fast-growing area, ensuring that we have accurate and reliable detection is vital to the success of the project.  If you have an interest in working on new areas of research in the AI space, this is the project for you.

## Scope
- Develop a camera-based monitoring system to track and analyze consumer behaviour.
- Implement computer vision algorithms to capture and process the required metrics (dwell time, count, interactions, etc).
- Provide real-time feedback and analytics on advertising effectiveness.
- Generate heatmaps to visualize pedestrian traffic for optimal advertisement placement.
- Build a website to present this information
- Build automated AI training and inference pipelines

## Resources provided by client:

You will be provided access to the client’s research infrastructure for AI training.

Any additional services or compute required will be provided on request by students.

If students have access to their own GPU hardware, that would also be great.  Training AI Models can take a very long time on laptops.  We will be discouraging this method.  This is why we provide access to GPUs when needed on the project.

Compute should not be an issue with this project.

Data will be provided to the students as well.  We have large amounts of data and are using it ourselves to train models.  We are gathering more data every day.
