# Using AI to enhance construction site safety and detect if safety equipment is being used correctly

This project aims to leverage AI to enhance safety on construction sites by detecting whether workers are using safety equipment correctly. The project involves developing a computer vision system capable of recognizing various safety gear, such as helmets, vests, and gloves, and ensuring they are worn properly by workers. The goal is to reduce accidents and ensure compliance with safety regulations.

## Description
You will be using a pre-compiled dataset of construction workers with various image resolutions (ranging from very large to very small – some less than 50 pixels).  Your work will be a part of a larger AI pipeline.

The AI model in use now is a variant of the YOLOv8 model.  This project is open-ended and will allow you to be flexible in selecting, training and utilising the model that your team feels is the best for the job.

The team running this capstone project expects that you will need to learn lots on the project.  We have the experience to help you with the project and teach you more about AI, software design and best practices.   Making you the best developers out there.  

AI is a fast-growing area, ensuring that we have accurate and reliable detection is vital to the success of the project.  If you have an interest in working on new areas of research in the AI space, this is the project for you.

## Scope
- Research & Implement an AI detection model for construction safety equipment.
- Collate image datasets of people (client to assist)
- Train and evaluate the model using all datasets.
- Analyze performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and processing time.
- Provide recommendations based on the comparative analysis.
- Experiment with different types of models and find the best one.

## Resources provided by client:

You will be provided access to the client’s research infrastructure for AI training.

Any additional services or compute required will be provided on request by students.

If students have access to their own GPU hardware, that would also be great.  Training AI Models can take a very long time on laptops.  We will be discouraging this method.  This is why we provide access to GPUs when needed on the project.

Compute should not be an issue with this project.

Data will be provided to the students as well.  We have large amounts of data and are using it ourselves to train models.  We are gathering more data every day.
