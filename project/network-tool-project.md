# Building the best open-source network and device monitoring tool for everyone

## Description
This project aims to develop a comprehensive open-source network and device monitoring tool that provides deep insights into network activities without the need for network reconfiguration. 

The system consists of three main components:

1.	**Analytics and Tracking Dashboard (Server):** A centralized server to aggregate and display network and device analytics in a user-friendly dashboard.
2.	**Device App:** An application for self- or passive reporting by devices, capable of sending performance and status data to the central server.
3.	**Monitoring Server (Server App):** A server application for active monitoring of devices, ensuring real-time tracking and analysis.

Existing network management solutions often require routing all network traffic through a single point or reconfiguring network settings, which can be complex and intrusive. This project aims to simplify network analysis and management by providing a non-intrusive solution that integrates seamlessly with existing network setups.

The Device App will also provide a more comprehensive set of statistics from the device, such as CPU usage, GPU usage, attached hardware information, system temperatures and more.  This array of information is highly valued in a network administrator role.

A prototype for this project has already been developed in Django.  You will build on the models and concepts in Django for your final solution.

The team running this capstone project expects that you will need to learn lots on the project.  We have the experience to help you with the project and teach you more about networking, software design and best practices.   Making you the best developers out there.  

Networking is a constantly expanding area and crucial to today’s world.  Ensuring that we have accurate and reliable networking systems is vital to the success of the project.  If you want to build the next biggest open-source project, this is the project for you.


## Scope
- Develop a centralized analytics and tracking dashboard.
- Create a device app for passive reporting.
- Implement a monitoring server for active device tracking.
- Ensure the system provides comprehensive insights into network performance and security.
- Maintain an open-source approach to allow community contributions and transparency.
